# Desktop IDE Markdown Preview In-Situ Decorator

## Overview

Hooks into the IDE's Markdown rendering pipeline to provide rich GitHub/VS Code typography styling, syntax highlighting, synchronous bootstrap hooking (`earlyHook.js`), in-place DOM patching, and an in-situ comments drawer toggled via the floating MD FAB widget.

## User Journey (Gherkin Scenarios)

- Given a Markdown preview pane open in the IDE
- When the markdown engine parses the document tokens
- Then early bootstrap hook intercepts acquireVsCodeApi and prepares action dispatchers
- And typography styles matching the active VS Code theme and syntax highlighting are applied
- And anchored comments are injected alongside an interactive floating MD FAB toggle
- When a user clicks the MD FAB widget in the preview
- Then the comments sidebar drawer slides open smoothly
- When a user adds, replies to, edits, or reacts to comments
- Then comment cards and badges update in-place optimistically without document DOM reloading
- When a user initiates comment or reply deletion
- Then an in-webview confirmation modal prompts for confirmation and prevents resurrection via optimistic tombstones
- Given a markdown document with relative images open in the comment preview
- Then the images load from the workspace, also after the panel follows a link into another folder
